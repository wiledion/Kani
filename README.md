*Kani*
===================================================================

Presentation
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Kani is a 2D game written with the library Slick2D in Java. It take
 place in a world similar ancestral and precolonial Africa. The 
gameplay is inspired from hack and slash and RPG games.

Advancement
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The project is still in the phase of adding features. The scenario 
of the game is not yet taken into account in the game. There are 
some classes not yet implemented.

Media ressources
-------------------------------------------------------------------
For the moment, I use sprites extracted from The Legend of Zelda: 
A Link to the Past ( Super NES) et Pokémon Emerald ( Game Boy 
Advance ). I hope to find a volunteer graphist interested by the 
spirit of the project.
